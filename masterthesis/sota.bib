	abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a modified version of the RRT* motion planning algorithm, which limits the memory required for storing the tree. We run the RRT* algorithm until the tree has grown to a predefined number of nodes and afterwards we remove a weak node whenever a high performance node is added. A simple two-dimensional navigation problem is used to show the operation of the algorithm. The algorithm was also applied to a high-dimensional redundant robot manipulation problem to show the efficacy. The results show that our algorithm outperforms RRT and comes close to RRT* with respect to the optimality of returned path, while needing much less number of nodes stored in the tree.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a time-efﬁcient approach to generate safe, smooth and dynamically feasible trajectories for quadrotors in the obstacle-cluttered environment. By using the uniform B-spline to represent trajectories, we transform the trajectory planning to a graph-search problem of B-spline control points in discretized space. Highly strict convex hull property of B-spline is derived to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of the entire trajectory. A novel non-uniform kinodynamic search strategy is adopted, and the step length is dynamically adjusted during the search process according to the Euclidean signed distance ﬁeld (ESDF), making the trajectory achieve reasonable time-allocation and be away from obstacles. Nonstatic initial and goal states are allowed, therefore it can be used for online local replanning as well as global planning. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments show that our method achieves higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

This low cost, easily expandable and upgradeable flying robot is here characterized in terms of hardware and software. Three aspects, which demonstrate the potential of broad use of this unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by researchers and students, are discussed in the paper. The first one is an acquisition of measurement data from test flights by the proposed, freely available “black-box” software. The second is the use of a new, advanced 4FLY Simulator in order to utilize the MATLAB®/Simulink environment to easily implement a mathematical model of Crazyflie 2.0 dynamics, as well as for a synthesis of various types of controllers with support of OpenGL cross-language in the visualization of simulations results. The 4FLY Simulator allows to test autonomous flights (and landings) with obstacles avoidance and to conduct learning and teaching the basics of Crazyflie 2.0 piloting. In the third aspect the authors outlined promising, preliminary results obtained in control of flying robot by pointing device (positioner) and with the support of a vision system, which basis only on a single Kinect sensor.},
