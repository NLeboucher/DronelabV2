artist does lineart :=> then and then coloriwaton

subject automatic lineart colorization

background
deeplearning
perceptron linear transformation
classification example
neural networks get wider and longer
wide we do not keep the folds
deepeper we keep the folds
=> thus deeplearning is prefered 
our target is y with y hat the obtained solution Loss = y - yhat
Background
the AE
the encoder with a latent space then a decoder
wasserstein distance

Motivation
challenges in automatic lineart coloriwation

and major issues to work on, not robust 

contributions
    database made with qualitative classes
    paintstorch method1422
we have built an evaluation metric and use others
using MOS Mean Opinion score as art iis subjective
